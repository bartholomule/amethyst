The files in this directory are for reference only.  They come from other projects
and some were hacked quickly to get an idea across.  Testing should be performed
on anything in here that is desireable to use.

In general, a file with an '.hpp' extension is newer than one with a '.h' 
extension, so check the .hpp file first.
